Implement responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile).
Host on Surge.
The app needs to have a filter function on the side of the page that allows the user to select the type of activity and number of participants.
The app will also display the activity along with a related image. <br/>
**Post-MVP**:
If the user selects a group of 3 or more partipants, have a countdown timer and a voting function to decide whether the group will do the activity. If the majority chooses to pass, it will generate a new activity. <br/>
